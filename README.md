# Opencv
## In this repo we're going to review some of Opencv algorithms and methods to change your picture and detect objects in our picture.

This repo is bulit along with the course I've seen to learn opencv and we'll start with some basic method such as cvtColor and the deeper we go through course the more interesting the methods become
like we'll use yolo to detecte obejects or count coins with opencv itself and use some algorithms like Clahe and more.
